# IntroToRuby

Ruby is an open-source, high-level programming language that was first released in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan. It has a simple, elegant syntax that emphasizes readability and productivity, making it a popular choice for web development, especially with the Ruby on Rails framework.

Ruby is dynamically typed, meaning that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime. It also has automatic memory management, which frees developers from having to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation.

One of the unique features of Ruby is that it allows for "monkey patching," which means that developers can add, modify, or remove methods from existing classes at runtime. This makes it a flexible language for extending existing code or libraries.

Ruby also has a vibrant and supportive community, with numerous resources and documentation available online, as well as a wide range of libraries and frameworks for building web applications, desktop applications, and more.
